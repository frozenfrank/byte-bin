# DeLorean Transfer TODO list

## Easy Fixes
- [ ] Format "Report date" with the day of the week
- [ ] Add next/prev buttons for switching days
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for key workflows (next/prev/toggle switch)
- [ ] Constrain horizontal width of content
- [ ] Add a splash of color, maybe with a colored header
- [ ] Show distinct descriptions sorted by total duration

## Big Upgrades
