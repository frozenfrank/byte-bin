# DeLorean Transfer TODO list

## Easy Fixes
- [x] Format "Report date" with the day of the week
- [x] Add next/prev buttons for switching days
- [x] Add keyboard shortcuts for key workflows (next/prev/toggle switch)
- [ ] Constrain horizontal width of content
- [x] Add a splash of color, maybe with a colored header
- [ ] Show distinct descriptions sorted by total duration
- [x] Move into sub-folder
- [ ] Show all data (even those without TLPs)
- [ ] Convert "Import" section to ask for data method first, then include input prompts
- [ ] Show relative time since last data update, with total number of time entries received
- [ ] Actually move focus when using accelerator keys

## Big Upgrades
- [ ] File data automatically into DeLorean
- [x] Leverage Toggl APIs to get data directly
- [ ] Migrate to framework UI with table elements, ghost rows, blank screen, bolding, etc (React or Angular or Svelt)
