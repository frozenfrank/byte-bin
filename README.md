# byte-bin
A collection of handy utility functions, scripts, and random coding snippets gathered over time.
From small code hacks to reusable features, this is the go-to bin for all those useful bytes of code!

## Installation
After cloning the repo, install the shell scripts on your `PATH` with the following:
```shell
export PATH="path/to/byte-bin/shell:$PATH"
```

This will allow your shell to autocomplete and run the scripts natively.
