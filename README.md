# Odysseus Decision Tree Analysis

## Project Summary
This project analyzes Odysseus's decision-making in *The Odyssey* through a modern algorithmic lens. It explores the complexities of his 10-year journey home after the Trojan War, focusing on the cultural incentives, risks, and consequences of his choices. Key themes include the decision to visit unknown islands, the impact of lingering in foreign lands, and the logical necessity of navigating threats like Scylla and Charybdis. The analysis highlights Odysseus's troubled heroism, where each decision—made with incomplete information—carries unavoidable costs, reflecting the challenges of leadership under pressure.

## Slide Image Description
The image presents a wide-screen visual metaphor for Odysseus’s journey, depicting a branching path across a stylized sea with islands, obstacles, and decision points. Each path segment illustrates key dilemmas—such as encounters with monsters, temptations, and allies—emphasizing the algorithmic complexity of his choices. The minimalist, clean design invites viewers to interpret the hero’s troubled voyage without text.

## Decision Tree Overview
The decision tree maps out many of the key decisions Odysseus made during his journey, such as whether to visit islands, how long to stay, and how to face monstrous threats. Each decision point includes alternative choices and potential outcomes (bad, okay, or good), sampling the vast complexity of his path—estimated at 5.15×10^47 possible routes. The tree visualizes the trade-offs between immediate dangers and long-term goals, reflecting the essay's argument that Odysseus's choices were often reasonable given the cultural context and limited knowledge, despite their tragic outcomes.
